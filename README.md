## 📜 About the Project

This is a simple survival game where the player controls a mouse character that moves left or right using the keyboard. The mouse must avoid obstacles, such as stones and birds, while running. If the mouse hits a stone or is caught by the cat, the game ends. The game tracks the mouse's survival time, which is shown as the score.
